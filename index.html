        <h2>QA Engineer Journey</h2>
        <p>I began my journey at Fanafzar - FanGames as a QA Tester/Localization Tester, where we published games and mostly translation was done on our end. 
        Then started working as a QA Tester and moved to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/simulator-developer/">Simulator Developer</a> AKA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714111201/http://www.zorvangamestudio.com/">Zorvan Game studio</a>.
        (The website is down unfortunately. but here is an <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/483860-80#overview">overreview</a> on pitchbook.)</p>
        
        <p>This was the first place I actually worked in a real deal game studio. We worked on two mobile game projects with different genres. Tactics was a real time strategy game with similarities to Boom Beach
          and the other project was called Northern Farm which was farming simulation game. Each had its own challenges. So, I became familiar with the concepts and got mesmorised by the magic of games and Game Design. 
          As I was working on my QA skillsets, I was learning more and more about games, their mechanincs, dynamics, and the Magic behind the scenes. One the things I really liked about Game design was the statistics. 
          The data which was playing a key role in everything. Data spoke to us as the messenger of the unknown world of player's feelings, taste, emotions, likes and dislikes. We could understand what players like and how to utilize elements 
          of the game to increase that. The data was also playing a key role in telling us how campaigns and Live Operations are helping us to increase the Retention Rates. 
          However, data couldn't exactly tell us why players churn and this was always a puzzle to solve on the side of Game Designers. This is why I love game design. The challenge itself is a game of its own. 
          a continued momentum of whether you beat yourself and win more players, or you start over again. So overall, I continued the journey and attended a handful number of courses on Game Design to actually 
      understand what are the main gears in first building/creating a game, then keeping it alive.<p/>
        <p>But the I knew for a fact that this is just the begining, so I moved to another Company on a project which was called <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/>, unfortunately after Zorvan was disbanded.
         On <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/> project I began to work as a QA Engineer and started learning more about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA fundementals on Softwares. </p>

        <h2>Machine Learning journey</h2>
        <p>I started this all because of a simple CAPTCHA. During a routine automation test, I figured that my automation code could not pass this CAPTCHA. And I wondered why? why there are CAPTCHA's and what's their Tech? 
        So I began researching about them until I got to the point that this all is related to Machine Learning and Image Processing.</p>
