        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Amir Sasani, I am  a QA Engineer, a ML enthusiastic and a programmer to be. My contacts info are <a href="mailto:amirhsamson93@gmail.com">amirhsamson93@gmail.com</a> and (+98) 9302706365.</p>

        <h2>QA Engineer Journey</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>I began as a QA Tester on Fanafzar - FanGames as a localization tester, where we published games and mostly translation was done on our side. 
            Then started working as a QA Tester and moved to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/simulator-developer/">Simulator Developer</a> AKA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714111201/http://www.zorvangamestudio.com/">Zorvan Game studio</a>.
            (The website is down unfortunately. but here is an <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/483860-80#overview">overreview</a> on pitchbook.)
            This was the first place I actually worked in a real deal game studio. I became familiar with the concepts and got mesmorised by the magic of games and Game Design. 
            Continued the journey and attended a handful number of courses on Game Design. 
            But the I knew for a fact that this is just the begining, so I moved to another Company on a project which was call PlayPod, after Zorvan was disbanded.
            On <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/> project I began to work as a QA Engineer and started 
            <a href="https://omidshahbazi.github.io/Materials/DOD/Presentation.pdf">Presentation</a> and here <a href="https://github.com/omidshahbazi/DODSample">DODSample</a></p>

        <h2>Game Engine</h2>
        <p>My main project in Github is my latest Game-Engine project which started in Feb 2015, Recently, I decided to make it public and available to other programmers out there, it's just an experimental project</p>
