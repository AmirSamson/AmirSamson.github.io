        <h2>QA Engineer Journey</h2>
      <h3>Fanafzar - FanGames:</h3>
        <p>I began my journey at Fanafzar - FanGames as a QA Tester/Localization Tester, where we published games and mostly translation was done on our end. We published and localized over 30+ titles 
        from different companies around the globe. There were actually no specific genre and we published a variety of different genres such as Action, MMO, RPG, Sports (Soccer, NBA, etc.) and so on. 
        Some of the titles included:</p> 
        <p>OverKill 3, Top Farm, Farm Town, Farm Paradise, Crime Coast, Mad Tanks, Nova Empire, قرش لطبلا- Rise of heroes, Defense Zone 3, Dragon Ninjas, CandyDash, Warzone Clash of generals, 
        Lewandowski: Football Star, Best Bug Brawl, Vip Hokm (by CASUALINO), killTwins: Football Game and NBA General Manager 2019 </p>
        <p>Later On, we managed to develop two Hybrid Cloud-Based Game-Marketplace Android apps - "BaziGushi" and "Porbazi" - in Iranian Android marketplaces such as Cafe Bazar and Myket.
        This was my first real experiences as a QA Tester on testing Android apps and I managed to quality verfiy (QV) mentioned apps. However, due to some challenges in the market and a huge competitor with a ton of money
        for advertisement which took over the market single handedly, we weren't so lucky and couldn't make a safe deal with the investors. and the project was taken down after a couple of weeks.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Simulator Developer AKA Zorvan:</h3>
        <p>Then started working as a QA Tester and moved to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180830171458/http://simulator.ir/games/">Simulator Developer</a> AKA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714111201/http://www.zorvangamestudio.com/">Zorvan Game Studio</a>.
        (The website is down, unfortunately. but here is an <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/483860-80#overview">overeview</a> on Pitchbook.). 
        This was the first place I actually worked in a real-deal game studio. We worked on two mobile game projects with different genres.
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210516171858/http://zorvangamestudio.com/portfolio/tactics-game/">Tactics</a> was a real-time strategy game with similarities to Boom Beach and the other project
        was called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210516183427/http://zorvangamestudio.com/portfolio/rastak-game/">Northern Farm</a> which was a farming simulation game. Each had its challenges. 
        So, I became familiar with the concepts and got mesmerised by the magic of games and Game Design. 
        As I was working on my QA skillsets, I was learning more and more about games, their mechanics, dynamics, and the Magic behind the scenes. One of the things I really liked about Game design was the statistics. 
        The data played a key role in everything. Data spoke to us as the messenger of the unknown world of player's feelings, tastes, emotions, likes and dislikes. We could understand what players like and how to utilize elements 
        of the game to increase that. The data was also playing a key role in telling us how campaigns and Live Operations are helping us to increase the Retention Rates. 
        However, data couldn't exactly tell us why players churn and this was always a puzzle to solve on the side of Game Designers. This is why I love game design. The challenge itself is a game of its own. 
        a continued momentum of whether you beat yourself and win more players, or you start over again. So overall, I continued the journey and attended a handful number of courses on Game Design to actually 
        understand what are the main gears in first building/creating a game, then keeping it alive.<p/>

        <h3>Alpha Cloud:</h3>
        <p>Sad news was: Unfortunately, Zorvan game studio was disbanded. So, I had to pack my bags and move to another company. This time, Eastern Wind got me to <a href="https://playpod.ir/about/?lang=en">Playpod</a>. A company
        which had a project named <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/>. Playpod is a Cloud-Gaming platform for eSports, the first cloud gaming console in the Middle East, which allows players to have the opportunity to play without having any type of consoles 
          (Xbox, Playstation, etc.) or any gaming hardware. User can access Playpod, only by oppening the Playpod app on their phones (iOS and Android) or the Web browser on their laptop or PC 
          and play brand new and top ranked games, for FREE!
        On <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/> project I began to work as a QA Engineer and started learning more about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA fundamentals on Software. As I was enhancing my self with
          more QA knowledge, I was able to have experience on different technologies used for CLoud platforms and Cloud gaming.
        </p>
        <p>(Plypod later on went under a parent company called <a href="https://www.alphaco.cloud/">Alpha Cloud</a>)</p>

        <h3>ICE GLOBAL:</h3>
<p>When I first joined ICE, I thought my job would be pretty straightforward — test features, report bugs, and keep things moving. But very quickly, I realized this place was different. QA wasn’t a quiet corner where we just tick boxes. At ICE, <strong>quality was everyone’s job</strong>, and I had the opportunity to <strong>become the voice of that quality</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn’t just test tickets. I <strong>lived inside them</strong>. I read every word of the user stories, challenged unclear requirements, double-checked designs, and chased down edge cases no one else had even thought about. I wanted to make sure that when something left our hands, it actually <strong>made sense for the people using it</strong>, whether they were resellers, customers, or internal teams.</p>
<p>One of my biggest lessons came when the QA lead went on leave. I could have just quietly done my own work, but instead, I <strong>stepped up and took the wheel</strong>. I ran daily standups, monitored every channel, followed up with developers, product managers, and designers, and made sure nothing slipped through the cracks. It wasn’t easy — but that week taught me that <strong>leadership isn’t a title</strong>. It’s about <strong>showing up when you’re needed the most</strong>.</p>
<p>There was also this one sprint I’ll never forget. Our delivery rate had been hovering around 56% — not terrible, but not great either. That sprint, we made it to <strong>86%</strong>. And I knew it wasn’t magic. It happened because we <strong>worked smarter</strong>, communicated better, and I made sure QA wasn’t just blocking tickets but actively <strong>helping developers move faster</strong> by being clear, proactive, and hands-on.</p>
<p>But my role at ICE wasn’t just about speed. It was about <strong>caring</strong>. I didn’t just want to sign off on a ticket because it "technically worked." I cared about <strong>how it felt for the user</strong>. Did the flow make sense? Was the error message clear? Could a reseller figure this out on their own at midnight when no one was around to help? That mindset shaped every conversation I had — whether I was pushing back on a design, adding clarifications to a ticket, or jumping into a Slack thread to explain why a small detail actually mattered.</p>
<p>Another thing I’m proud of is the <strong>documentation footprint</strong> I left behind. Every process, every tricky flow, every lesson learned — I documented it. Not because someone asked me to, but because I wanted the next person joining QA to have a <strong>smoother ride than I did</strong>. To me, documentation is how you say: "I care about the future of this team."</p>
<p>And through all of this, I realized that being a great QA isn’t about being the person who says "no" the loudest. It’s about being the person who <strong>asks the right questions</strong>, who <strong>connects the dots between teams</strong>, who <strong>sees risks before they happen</strong>, and who <strong>stands up for quality, even when timelines get tight and pressure runs high</strong>.</p>

<h3>Some Wins I’m Proud Of</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stepped in to <strong>lead QA efforts</strong> when the QA lead was away, managing all follow-ups, handovers, and processes</li>
<li>Owned and improved QA for features like the <strong>Mentorship Program, Reseller Journey, Fulfillment Process</strong>, and <strong>Wallet Management</strong></li>
<li>Helped the team go from <strong>56% delivery to 86%</strong> in one sprint by improving the way QA worked with Product and Engineering</li>
<li>Found and escalated critical production issues, some of which were <strong>fixed within hours</strong> thanks to fast reactions and thorough investigations</li>
<li>Created clear, practical <strong>documentation</strong> to make onboarding easier and processes smoother for future teammates</li>
<li>Worked across <strong>Product, Design, and Engineering</strong> to close gaps and <strong>prevent issues before they reached production</strong></li>
<li>Balanced speed and quality by focusing on what really mattered — <strong>the user’s experience</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day, my time at ICE wasn’t just about being a QA. It was about <strong>becoming someone the team could depend on</strong>, someone who wasn’t afraid to <strong>ask uncomfortable questions</strong>, and someone who <strong>never forgot that every ticket was more than just a task — it was a small part of someone’s experience with our product</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s the kind of QA I am. And that’s the kind of QA I’ll continue to be.</p>

        <h2>Machine Learning journey</h2>
        <p>I started this all because of a simple CAPTCHA. To address this more accurately, my interest in embarking on a journey in Computer Science stems from the early years of my career as a QA engineer. 
        While writing a routine automation test for a login page on a website, I noticed that the test run could not proceed any further, simply because of a CAPTCHA which was at the bottom of the page. 
        This made me curious to research about CAPTCHA and its underlying technology. This exploration led me to understand the principles of image processing, pattern recognition, and optical character 
        recognition (OCR) that underpin CAPTCHA systems. Moving on, I thought to myself if a robot/machine could learn the details of a picture and make a decision based on that, then what are the other 
        applications of this magnificent technology and its applications. Fascinated by this technology, I delved into the realm of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and continued the research. 
        Regarding that I hold 2 years of experience in the game industry as a Game designer and a QA Engineer, I knew for a fact that if I could dive deeper into Computer Vision as an academic study, I could 
        understand and utilize this technology in a more advanced sense. Ultimately, I would be able to apply what I have gained, into the development of more immersive and realistic games utilizing 
        computer vision, specifically AR and VR. </p>
