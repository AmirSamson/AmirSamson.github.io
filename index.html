        <h2>QA Engineer Journey</h2>
        <p>I began my journey at Fanafzar - FanGames as a QA Tester/Localization Tester, where we published games and mostly translation was done on our end. 
        Then started working as a QA Tester and moved to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180830171458/http://simulator.ir/games/">Simulator Developer</a> AKA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714111201/http://www.zorvangamestudio.com/">Zorvan Game Studio</a>.
        (The website is down, unfortunately. but here is an <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/483860-80#overview">overeview</a> on Pitchbook.)</p>

        <h3>Simulator Developer AKA Zorvan:</h3>
        <p>This was the first place I actually worked in a real-deal game studio. We worked on two mobile game projects with different genres.
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210516171858/http://zorvangamestudio.com/portfolio/tactics-game/">Tactics/a> was a real-time strategy game with similarities to Boom Beach and the other project
            was called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210516183427/http://zorvangamestudio.com/portfolio/rastak-game/">Northern Farm</a> which was a farming simulation game. Each had its challenges. 
            So, I became familiar with the concepts and got mesmerised by the magic of games and Game Design. 
          As I was working on my QA skillsets, I was learning more and more about games, their mechanics, dynamics, and the Magic behind the scenes. One of the things I really liked about Game design was the statistics. 
          The data played a key role in everything. Data spoke to us as the messenger of the unknown world of player's feelings, tastes, emotions, likes and dislikes. We could understand what players like and how to utilize elements 
          of the game to increase that. The data was also playing a key role in telling us how campaigns and Live Operations are helping us to increase the Retention Rates. 
          However, data couldn't exactly tell us why players churn and this was always a puzzle to solve on the side of Game Designers. This is why I love game design. The challenge itself is a game of its own. 
          a continued momentum of whether you beat yourself and win more players, or you start over again. So overall, I continued the journey and attended a handful number of courses on Game Design to actually 
      understand what are the main gears in first building/creating a game, then keeping it alive.<p/>

        <h3>Alpha Cloud:</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately after Zorvan was disbanded, I moved to another Company which at the time was called <a href="https://playpod.ir/about/?lang=en">Playpod/a> and it had a project named 
            <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/>. But I knew for a fact that this was just the beginning.
         On <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/> project I began to work as a QA Engineer and started learning more about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA fundamentals on Software.

        <h2>Machine Learning journey</h2>
        <p>I started this all because of a simple CAPTCHA. To address this more accurately, my interest in embarking on a journey in Computer Science stems from the early years of my career as a QA engineer. 
        While writing a routine automation test for a login page on a website, I noticed that the test run could not proceed any further, simply because of a CAPTCHA which was at the bottom of the page. 
        This made me curious to research about CAPTCHA and its underlying technology. This exploration led me to understand the principles of image processing, pattern recognition, and optical character 
        recognition (OCR) that underpin CAPTCHA systems. Moving on, I thought to myself if a robot/machine could learn the details of a picture and make a decision based on that, then what are the other 
        applications of this magnificent technology and its applications. Fascinated by this technology, I delved into the realm of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and continued the research. 
        Regarding that I hold 2 years of experience in the game industry as a Game designer and a QA Engineer, I knew for a fact that if I could dive deeper into Computer Vision as an academic study, I could 
        understand and utilize this technology in a more advanced sense. Ultimately, I would be able to apply what I have gained, into the development of more immersive and realistic games utilizing 
        computer vision, specifically AR and VR. </p>
