        <h2>QA Engineer Journey</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>I began as a QA Tester on Fanafzar - FanGames as a localization tester, where we published games and mostly translation was done on our side. 
            Then started working as a QA Tester and moved to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/simulator-developer/">Simulator Developer</a> AKA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714111201/http://www.zorvangamestudio.com/">Zorvan Game studio</a>.
            (The website is down unfortunately. but here is an <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/483860-80#overview">overreview</a> on pitchbook.)</p>
        
        <p>This was the first place I actually worked in a real deal game studio. I became familiar with the concepts and got mesmorised by the magic of games and Game Design. 
            Continued the journey and attended a handful number of courses on Game Design. <p/>
        <p>But the I knew for a fact that this is just the begining, so I moved to another Company on a project which was call PlayPod, after Zorvan was disbanded.
            On <a href="https://playpod.ir/">Playpod</a/> project I began to work as a QA Engineer and started learning more about Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA fundementals on Softwares. </p>
            
            

        <h2>Machine Learning journey</h2>
        <p>I started this all because of a simple CAPTCHA. During a routine automation test, I figured that my automation code could not pass this CAPTCHA. And I wondered why? why there are CAPTCHA's and what's their Tech? 
        So I began researching about them until I got to the point that this all is related to Machine Learning and Image Processing.</p>
